      title: 'Research Overview'
      text: >
        My primary research focus is in inverse problems, focusing on data-driven regularisation methods. I am intrigued by inverse problems (specifically those found in imaging applications such as in CT or MRI scans), Machine Learning, and numerical optimisation. My PhD seeks to learn data-driven techniques to help solve inverse problems derived from a variational regularisation modelling approach. 

        The PhD is under the supervision of [Dr. Yury Korolev](https://yury-korolev.gitlab.io/) and [Dr. Matthias Ehrhardt](https://mehrhardt.github.io/index.html). More generally, my interests span numerical analysis, mathematical modelling, and machine learning (ML).

        During my PhD at the University of Bath, I worked in interdisciplinary teams to formulate mathematical problems from high-level applied challenges in collaboration with industrial partners. These events are known as Integrative Think Tanks ([ITTs](https://samba.ac.uk/working-with-samba/integrative-think-tanks-itts/)):
